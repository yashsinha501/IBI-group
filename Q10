The output of the code will be:

1
4
2
3

Now explanation of code :

1. `console.log(1);`: This is a synchronous operation, so it will be the first thing logged to the console. The output will be `1`.

2. `setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);`: This is an asynchronous operation using `setTimeout`. Despite the delay being set to 0 milliseconds, it
   doesn't mean the callback will be executed immediately. Instead, it will be added to the event queue and executed after the synchronous code 
   has finished executing.

3. `setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);`: This is another asynchronous operation using `setTimeout`. The callback function will be executed after a
   delay of 100 milliseconds. Since this operation has a longer delay than the previous one, its callback will be executed later.

4. `console.log(4);`: This is another synchronous operation, so it will be the third thing logged to the console after `1`. The output will be `4`.

Now, the event queue looks like this:

- Event Queue: `[function(){printNumber(2)}, function(){printNumber(3)}]`

The event loop is responsible for checking if the call stack (where synchronous code execution happens) is empty and then picking the first
function from the event queue and moving it to the call stack for execution. Since the call stack is empty after executing `1` and `4`, the event 
loop will execute the functions in the order they were added to the queue:

5. The function `printNumber(2)` is executed, and `2` is logged to the console.

6. After a delay of 100 milliseconds, the function `printNumber(3)` is executed, and `3` is logged to the console.
